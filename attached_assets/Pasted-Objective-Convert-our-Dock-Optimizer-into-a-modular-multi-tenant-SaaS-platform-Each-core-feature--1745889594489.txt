Objective: Convert our Dock Optimizer into a modular, multi-tenant SaaS platform. Each core feature (Appointments, Calendar, Assets, Notifications, Analytics, etc.) should be individually toggleable per client, with robust admin tools to easily manage tenant accounts and their feature access.

Required Features:
1. Monorepo & Modularization (Backend)
Reorganize backend code into clearly-separated modules within a single monorepo:

Appointment Booking

Calendar Management

Asset Management

Email Notifications

Analytics and Reporting

Each module should:

Have its own clearly-defined API endpoints and controllers.

Have independent CRUD operations.

Be individually testable.

2. Feature Flags Service (Backend)
Create a centralized Feature Flag Service that tracks which modules/features are enabled per tenant.

Store flags persistently (e.g., database or configuration store).

Provide clear API endpoints to toggle features on/off at runtime.

3. Admin UI: Tenant Management (Frontend)
Add a new "Tenant Management" section to the admin UI.

Capabilities include:

Creating, editing, and deleting tenants (accounts).

Assigning or revoking access to specific modules/features via intuitive toggles.

Viewing lists of tenants and enabled features clearly.

4. User Management & Permissions (Frontend/Backend)
Each tenant account should manage its own user list.

Admins should be able to:

View all users per tenant.

Edit user permissions and access levels (basic, admin, etc.).

Deactivate or delete users.

5. Frontend Module Visibility
Update frontend application code so each module conditionally renders based on tenant-specific feature flags.

If a feature is toggled off:

Its associated navigation links/buttons/UI are hidden.

All related routes are restricted and gracefully redirect users to allowed areas.

Technical Guidance & Best Practices:
Use Next.js or similar frameworks to leverage dynamic imports and code splitting effectively.

React Context or a global state-management solution (Redux, Zustand) should handle real-time feature-flag updates.

API endpoints should be secured with proper authentication (JWT) and authorization middleware to verify tenant permissions consistently.

Proposed PR Structure for Sprint 5:
PR 1 (Backend Monorepo Reorg):

Break backend logic into clearly separated modules/packages.

Refactor endpoints to modularized structure.

PR 2 (Feature Flag Service):

Implement persistent storage for tenant feature flags.

Expose RESTful API endpoints for toggling flags.

PR 3 (Frontend Tenant Management UI):

Build tenant CRUD operations and feature toggles UI.

Ensure intuitive and error-free admin experience.

PR 4 (User Management & Permissions):

UI & backend endpoints for viewing/editing tenant users.

Permissions handling per module access.

PR 5 (Module-Based Conditional Rendering):

Dynamically render/hide modules on frontend based on active feature flags.

Implement graceful error handling and redirection if users attempt unauthorized access.

Acceptance Criteria:
 Backend clearly structured into modularized packages.

 Admins can easily create/manage tenants and toggle features.

 Users see only authorized modules; unauthorized access routes are restricted gracefully.

 Tenant-specific user management is fully operational and intuitive.

 Application remains performant and maintainable after modularization.

QA Checks Before Completion:

Verify module toggles in real-time.

Confirm that unauthorized users never see disabled features.

Check tenant/user CRUD workflows thoroughly.

Validate stable performance and zero regressions.
