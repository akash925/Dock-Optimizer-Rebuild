Context:

We are working with a full-stack TypeScript application featuring a modular, multi-tenant SaaS architecture. The backend utilizes Express.js with a controller-service-repository pattern, Zod for validation, and Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL interactions. The frontend is built with React, employing ShadCn UI, React Query, Wouter, and Tailwind CSS.

Objectives:

Resolve /api/org/hours Endpoint Issues:

Ensure that the endpoint returns the correct organizational hours, defaulting appropriately when specific configurations are absent.

Validate that the org_hours data is correctly fetched and utilized in the booking flow.

Correct Appointment Questions Ordering:

Ensure that appointment-related questions are prioritized and displayed first in the booking interface.

Verify that the questions are fetched and rendered in the intended sequence.

Audit and Refactor Booking Flow:

Review the booking logic to ensure seamless data flow from question selection to appointment confirmation.

Identify and rectify any discrepancies between the frontend and backend data handling.

Enhance Error Handling and Validation:

Implement comprehensive error handling across the booking modules to prevent silent failures.

Ensure that all inputs are validated both on the client and server sides.

Tasks:

Backend:

Inspect the controller, service, and repository layers associated with the /api/org/hours endpoint.

Ensure that the default organizational hours are correctly defined and returned when specific configurations are missing.

Review the logic responsible for fetching and ordering appointment questions, ensuring that appointment-related questions are prioritized.

Implement necessary adjustments to the service or repository layers to enforce the correct ordering.

Add robust error handling to catch and log any issues during data retrieval or processing.
