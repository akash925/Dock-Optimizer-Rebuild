You are helping finalize a critical SaaS dock scheduling app, Dock Optimizer. You are addressing remaining P0 issues before launch. DO NOT BREAK ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY. Follow these tasks precisely and fix each one-by-one, committing checkpoints after each.

🔧 TASKS (ordered by priority):
1. 🔐 Fix BOL Document Display in Appointment Modal:
✅ BOLs are uploading and saving in DB.

❌ BOL documents are not showing up in the "Bill of Lading Documents" section inside the Appointment Details modal.

✅ Null safety is in place now, but ensure file name, uploadedAt, and view/download link show if available.

✅ Check if appointment.bolDocuments is populated, and use appointment.bolDocuments[0]?.fileUrl or similar for display.

🔍 Use a FileCheck icon, filename, and download link.

2. 🔢 Fix Appointment Confirmation Code Visibility:
❌ Confirmation code is now missing from the Appointment Details modal.

✅ Use: appointment.confirmationCode || "HZL-" + appointment.id.toString().padStart(6, "0")

💡 Display this in the modal’s styled Badge or span, just below the "Appointment Confirmation Code" label.

3. 📄 Fix Booking Confirmation Page Details:
❌ Booking confirmation page shows QR + code but not any other appointment data.

✅ Pull from the final submitted appointment: driver, email, truck #, customer, etc.

🔍 File: client/src/pages/external/booking-confirmed.tsx

✅ Also display the BOL upload message (already there) and confirmation code.

✅ If email sending fails, show toast + yellow alert.

4. 🧾 Fix Customer Name & Email Required Fields in Booking Flow:
❌ Booking form allows creating appointments without customerName or email → breaks calendar display.

✅ These fields must be required after facility + appointment type are selected.

✅ They can be renamed (e.g., "Carrier Name" or "Vendor") per tenant, but underlying fields must be present.

🔍 Enforce this in StandardQuestionsFormFields logic.

5. 📆 Clean Up Calendar Header White Space:
❌ Calendar week view header cells (Sun/Mon/Tue...) have spacing issues.

✅ Fix .fc-col-header-cell and .fc-day to align to grid.

🔍 File: client/src/components/calendar/calendar-enhanced.css

🧪 Sanity Checks:
Appointment creation works from public booking page

Booking confirmation shows appointment metadata + QR + BOL info

Admin calendar page renders without crash

Appointment modal shows confirmation code + BOL document info

✅ After completing each item, checkpoint with a short note (e.g. “Fixed BOL document display in modal ✅”).
❌ Do not refactor types, API, or components outside the listed tasks unless directly related.
🧠 Think like an engineer shipping production-grade SaaS code.
