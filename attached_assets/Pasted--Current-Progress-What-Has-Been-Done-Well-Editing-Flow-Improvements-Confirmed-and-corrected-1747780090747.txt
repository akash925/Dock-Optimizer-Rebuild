📌 Current Progress (What Has Been Done Well):
✅ Editing Flow Improvements:

Confirmed and corrected logic to always start at Step 1 when clicking Edit on an appointment type or custom field.

✅ Duplicate Function and References Fixed:

Identified and resolved duplicate declarations of loadCustomQuestionsForAppointmentType.

Fixed all references to use the consistent and correct fetchCustomQuestions function.

✅ Better Logging & Debugging:

Comprehensive logging implemented, enabling easier tracing of errors and state management.

🚩 Remaining Issues (Identified but Need Further Validation):
🔴 Custom Questions Persistence
While UI enhancements and logging improvements are in place, there is still uncertainty if questions persist in backend/database correctly.

Required and Included flags appear correctly in UI after initial save but need extensive testing across page reloads and fresh edits.

🔴 Question Bank Concept (Mentioned Previously)
Previously discussed functionality where standard/custom questions can be toggled ("Included" and "Required") needs validation and clear backend/frontend linkage.

Ensure the backend explicitly handles toggling and persisting these settings.

⚙️ Technical & Architectural Recommendations:
1. Backend API & Data Model Audit:
Ensure API clearly handles the saving and retrieval of questions with consistent response structures.

Confirm database schema clearly reflects the included and required flags explicitly for each question per appointment type:

sql
Copy
Edit
appointment_questions {
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  appointmentTypeId INTEGER REFERENCES appointment_types(id),
  question TEXT,
  answerType TEXT,
  included BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
}
2. Robust Frontend State Management:
Utilize a consistent state management approach (React state/hooks) to synchronize backend responses with frontend UI state immediately upon save:

typescript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  fetchCustomQuestions(appointmentTypeId).then(questions => setQuestions(questions));
}, [appointmentTypeId]);
Ensure the handleSaveQuestions method accurately updates state upon successful API response:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const handleSaveQuestions = async () => {
  const response = await api.saveQuestions(appointmentTypeId, questions);
  if (response.ok) {
    setQuestions(response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Error saving questions:", response.error);
  }
};
3. Clear and Unified Question Bank Handling:
If implementing a Question Bank concept, ensure a clear backend model:

sql
Copy
Edit
question_bank {
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  question TEXT UNIQUE,
  defaultIncluded BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  defaultRequired BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
}
Appointment type questions should reference this bank for consistency across various appointment types.

📋 Immediate Testing & Validation Checklist:
 Custom Questions Persistence:

Test adding new custom questions → Save → Refresh → Verify persistence.

Verify toggling "Included"/"Required" flags persists correctly upon reload.

 Edit Flow Validation:

Ensure editing always initiates from Step 1.

Confirm step navigation is consistent.

 Error Handling & Logging:

Verify comprehensive logs on errors for backend and frontend.

 Full-cycle API Endpoint Testing:

Ensure API calls handle create/update/retrieve operations accurately and consistently reflect UI state.
