We’re preparing for release in two days. Please tackle these three small but critical fixes—and feel free to add any similarly low‑stakes polish you spot—then ship as a self‑contained PR:

1. Fix BOL file upload validation
Symptoms: On the external booking page (Step 1 & Step 3) PDF uploads are rejected with “File type not supported,” even though accept="application/pdf, image/*, .doc, .docx" is set.

Action:

Audit the <input type="file"> accept attribute and any custom client‑side MIME/type checks.

Normalize MIME strings (e.g. allow application/PDF, uppercase extensions).

Update validation logic to accept .pdf, .doc, .docx, and any common image types.

Add a unit test (or jest snapshot) for upload of a PDF file to confirm it passes.

Ensure the red error banner only appears on truly unsupported files, and that a successful upload shows the standard “BOL Uploaded” preview.

2. Simplify “Visit Booking Page” link behavior
Symptoms: In the top‑nav → Booking Pages menu, clicking “Test Booking Page” opens the dropdown menu rather than taking the user directly to the live scheduler.

Action:

In the BookingPagesMenu (or wherever that dropdown lives), change the “Test Booking Page” item from a menu‑trigger to a direct <Link to="/external/test‑booking‑page"> (or window.location.href = ...) so it navigates immediately.

Remove any extra click handler that pops open the submenu on that first item.

Add an E2E or integration test (Cypress/playwright) to confirm that clickUserMenu → “Test Booking Page” takes you straight to /external/test-booking-page.

3. Restore first‑step form layout & flow
Symptoms: External booking Step 1 now looks different, missing the location → appointment‑type chaining and BOL upload we had working.

Action:

Revert or re‑implement the “Location” dropdown at the top, then the filtered “Dock Appointment Type” select, then the “Pickup/Dropoff” radios, then the “BOL Upload” panel exactly as in our stable design.

Ensure selecting a location immediately repopulates the appointment‑type list.

Confirm the “Next” button only enables when those three are valid (plus BOL if required by questions).

Add snapshot tests for Step 1 in both mobile & desktop widths.

👍 Bonus low‑stakes polish (if time allows):

Autofocus the first field (Location) on Step 1.

Show a loading spinner on the upload button while OCR/compression is running.

Tighten up spacing under the Step progress bar to exactly match our Card margins.

Please group these into a single PR with clear commit messages (“fix: pdf upload validation,” “chore: booking‑page nav link,” “refactor: external booking step1 layout”) and include at least one regression test for each fix. Thank you!
