Thank you! The changes to `client/src/hooks/use-realtime-updates.tsx` look good for invalidating the `/api/availability/v2` cache.

Now, let's simplify `client/src/hooks/use-appointment-availability-fixed.tsx`. Since the `/api/availability/v2` endpoint now provides the definitive list of slots with their availability, capacity, and reasons, we no longer need the client-side logic to calculate this.

Task:
Modify `client/src/hooks/use-appointment-availability-fixed.tsx`:

1.  **Remove Redundant Logic:**
    * Delete the entire `generateTimeSlots` useCallback hook.
    * Delete the `WorkspaceAvailabilityRules` useCallback hook and the `availabilityRules` state.
    * Delete the `WorkspaceBookedAppointments` useCallback hook and the `bookedAppointments` state.
    * The `checkIsHoliday` function and its related logic can remain for now, as the `/v2` endpoint doesn't explicitly handle holidays yet (unless it was added to `calculateAvailabilitySlots` and I missed it). If `calculateAvailabilitySlots` *does* handle holidays, `checkIsHoliday` can also be removed from the client. For now, assume it might still be needed.

2.  **Simplify `WorkspaceAvailabilityForDate`:**
    * This function should ONLY:
        * Set loading state.
        * Perform the `checkIsHoliday` (if kept).
        * Make the API call to `/api/availability/v2` using `apiRequest`.
        * On successful response:
            * Extract `data.slots` (which is `AvailabilitySlot[]`).
            * Call `setAvailableTimeSlots(data.slots || []);`.
            * Call `onTimeSlotGenerated(data.slots || [], firstAvailableTimeFromDataSlots);` (derive `firstAvailableTimeFromDataSlots` from `data.slots`).
        * Handle errors by calling `setError`.
        * Set loading state to false in `finally`.
    * Remove any calls to the deleted functions (`generateTimeSlots`, `WorkspaceAvailabilityRules`, `WorkspaceBookedAppointments`) from within `WorkspaceAvailabilityForDate`.

3.  **Update `useEffect` and Dependencies:**
    * The `useEffect` that calls `WorkspaceAvailabilityForDate` should have its dependencies updated to reflect the simplified logic (e.g., remove dependencies on the deleted functions).
    * The `useCallback` dependency array for `WorkspaceAvailabilityForDate` should also be simplified.

**Output:**
Please provide the **complete, updated, and simplified content for `client/src/hooks/use-appointment-availability-fixed.tsx`**.
