We need to completely rebuild the **first step** of our external booking wizard so that:

1. **Step 1 fields appear in this exact order** (all on one page):
   - **Location** dropdown  
     • Populated from `bookingPage.facilities`  
     • `value=facility.id` → `facilityId` in form data  
   - **Dock Appointment Type** dropdown  
     • Only show types where `type.facilityId === selectedFacilityId`  
     • Sorted alphabetically by name  
     • `value=appointmentType.id` → `appointmentTypeId` in form data  
   - **Pickup / Dropoff** radio group  
     • Options “Pickup” / “Dropoff”  
     • `value="pickup"|"dropoff"` → `pickupOrDropoff`  
   - **Bill of Lading Upload** (optional)  
     • File input accepting PDF, DOC(X), JPG/PNG  
     • On change: read & OCR‑parse (use your existing FileReader + mock OCR), compress the file, extract BOL#, customerName, carrierName, date, notes  
     • Save parsed fields in form (but leave them editable in Steps 2/3)  

2. **Validation & UI**  
   - All four fields are `required` except BOL upload  
   - “Next” button only enables when location + appointmentType + pickupOrDropoff are selected  
   - If BOL is uploaded, show a preview panel beneath the upload box with the extracted values  

3. **Data flow**  
   - On submit → push `{ facilityId, appointmentTypeId, pickupOrDropoff, bolFileUploaded, bolExtractedData }` into your shared state and navigate to Step 2  
   - Do **not** call `/api/availability` or any date/time logic yet—this step is purely about choosing type & BOL  

4. **Remove any legacy “dock” or “appointmentType” references**  
   - Everywhere in this component, rename/rescope so you’re always using `facilityId` and `appointmentTypeId`  
   - Drop any code that fetched or rendered the old “external/test-booking-page” markup  

5. **UX polish**  
   - Use the same Grid/Card styling as before: left‑side info panel + right‑side form card  
   - Ensure mobile stacks gracefully  
   - Keep “Check out this video” link and the “Effective August 1st…” note at the bottom of the info panel  

Once you’ve implemented these changes, redeploy and verify:

- On Step 1, you see only Location → Type → Pickup/Dropoff → BOL Upload  
- The dropdowns filter correctly as soon as you pick a facility  
- “Next” remains greyed until all required fields are populated  
- BOL upload parsing works exactly as before  

After that’s solid, we’ll tackle Step 2 (date/time availability) with the new facility‑level hours and remaining‑slot badges.
