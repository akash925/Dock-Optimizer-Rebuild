Thank you for the detailed update and for successfully getting 13 out of 16 tests to pass in `server/src/services/availability.test.ts` by fixing the mocking issues! That's great progress.

Regarding the remaining 2 failing tests where the mock implementation calculates `remainingCapacity` as 2 but the tests expect 0:

**Please do NOT simply change the test expectation to match the current output yet.**

Instead, let's investigate *why* there's a discrepancy. The goal is to ensure `calculateAvailabilitySlots` is correctly implementing the business rule for maximum concurrent appointments.

Please help me debug this:

1.  **Focus on One Failing Test:** Identify one of the two failing capacity-related tests.
2.  **Show Test Setup:** For that specific failing test, please show:
    * The `appointmentType` mock data being used (especially the `maxConcurrent` value).
    * The mock data being returned by `(fetchRelevantAppointmentsForDay as vi.Mock).mockResolvedValue(...)` (i.e., the list of `existingAppointments` with their `startTime` and `endTime`).
    * The specific time slot (`timeStr`) for which the test is failing.
3.  **Show Relevant Service Logic:** Show the section of `calculateAvailabilitySlots` in `server/src/services/availability.ts` that calculates `conflictingApptsCount` and `remainingCapacity` for that slot.
4.  **Add Debug Logging (Inside `calculateAvailabilitySlots`):**
    Temporarily, right before the `remainingCapacity` is calculated for the failing slot time, please add console logs within `calculateAvailabilitySlots` to output:
    * The `timeStr` of the slot being processed.
    * The `currentSlotStartTime` and `currentSlotEndTime` (as ISO strings).
    * The value of `appointmentType.maxConcurrent` being used.
    * The number of `existingAppointments` being iterated over.
    * For each `existingAppointment`, log its `appt.startTime`, `appt.endTime`, and whether it was considered a conflict for the current slot.
    * The final `conflictingApptsCount` for that slot.
    * The calculated `remainingCapacity`.

5.  **Rerun the Failing Test:** Execute `npx vitest run server/src/services/availability.test.ts` (or the specific failing test if possible) again.

**Output:**
Please provide:
a. The code for the specific failing test case (including its mock setup for `appointmentType` and `WorkspaceRelevantAppointmentsForDay`).
b. The relevant snippet from `calculateAvailabilitySlots` where capacity is determined.
c. The console log output generated by the debug statements when the failing test runs.

This will help us understand if the issue is in the test's expectation, the mock data provided to the service, or the service's capacity calculation logic itself.
