Context:
  Our external “Booking Pages” wizard has drifted far from the look & feel and data‐persistence behavior defined by our admin controls (Appointment Master → Booking Page Styles). We’ve lost the step indicator styling, button theming, and fields aren’t persisting correctly between steps.

Goal:
  1. Re‑apply the admin‑configured theme and layout to every step of the booking wizard.  
  2. Restore the original UX (step header, progress bar, font sizes, spacing).  
  3. Guarantee that all form fields bind to the shared `BookingWizardContext` so values persist correctly when navigating back and forth.

Please:

1. **Fetch & Apply Admin Styles**  
   - On wizard mount, call `GET /api/admin/booking-styles` to retrieve theme (colors, fonts, button styles, progress‑bar height).  
   - Provide these via a `BookingThemeProvider` that injects CSS variables (e.g. `--primary-color`, `--font-family`, `--progress-height`).  

2. **Restore UX Layout**  
   - Wrap the wizard in a centered container matching the original max‑width (600px) and auto margins.  
   - Recreate the “STEP X OF 3” header bar with the green accent line and animated width transition.  
   - Use the admin’s font sizes for the step titles (e.g. 24px for headers, 16px for subtext) and revert to original padding and margins.

3. **Themed Components**  
   - Update `<Button>`, `<Input>`, `<Select>`, and `<DatePicker>` to use CSS vars for background, border, font, and focus states.  
   - Replace any hard‑coded colors in the wizard with the dynamic theme values.

4. **Context‑Bound Fields**  
   - Refactor every step component so each input’s `value` and `onChange` map directly to `BookingWizardContext` (no local `useState`).  
   - On moving between steps, always read and write fields from `bookingContext`.  
   - Initialize `bookingContext` with empty values on wizard start.

5. **Data Persistence Tests**  
   - Write unit tests for `BookingWizardContext` to assert that setting `bookingContext.fieldA` in Step 1 persists in Step 3.  
   - Add snapshot tests for each step with a sample admin theme applied.

6. **Visual Verification**  
   - Manually preview the wizard with a few different admin theme configurations to confirm dynamic styling and a faithful restoration of the original UX.  

Commit all changes as a single checkpoint so the external booking wizard once again matches the admin’s style settings, the original step‑by‑step UX, and reliably saves every field.
