Create and Validate Test Organization "Fresh Connect Central"

Task Overview:
Set up a new organization named "Fresh Connect Central" in the Dock Optimizer application to thoroughly test our deployment process and admin/module management system using existing infrastructure.

Detailed Requirements:
1. Create Organization:

Organization Name: Fresh Connect Central

Subdomain: Autogenerate or explicitly use fresh-connect-central.

Status: Active.

2. Add Organization User:

Name: Akash Agarwal

Email: akash@agarwalhome.com

Role: Organization Admin level credentials (full permissions within the org).

3. Configure Organization Modules: Enable all modules EXCEPT for:

❌ Asset Manager (explicitly disabled).

Enabled modules should include:

✅ Appointments

✅ Calendar

✅ Email Notifications

✅ Analytics

✅ Facility Management

✅ Door Manager

✅ User Management

✅ Booking Pages

4. Set Up Initial Facility:

Facility Name: Fresh Connect Central

Address: 3737 Waldemere Ave. Indianapolis, IN 46241

Implementation Instructions:
Perform the above using the existing admin infrastructure and API endpoints. Specifically, ensure:

Use the /api/admin/orgs endpoints to create the new organization.

Use the /api/admin/users endpoints to add the user Akash Agarwal and assign admin-level permissions to the newly created organization.

Use the /api/admin/orgs/:orgId/modules endpoints to explicitly configure modules, ensuring "Asset Manager" is explicitly disabled.

Use the /api/admin/facilities endpoints to add the specified facility to the organization.

Post-Implementation Validation Steps (Important!):
Explicitly validate and report clearly on the following to confirm success:

✅ Organization Created:

Confirm the organization appears correctly in the Super Admin’s organization list.

✅ User Added with Admin Privileges:

Confirm that user Akash Agarwal (akash@agarwalhome.com) appears in the organization’s users list with correct admin-level permissions.

✅ Module Configuration:

Confirm explicitly that all modules listed above are enabled, and "Asset Manager" is explicitly disabled.

Verify visibility in the organization's user interface navigation matches this setup.

✅ Facility Setup:

Confirm facility "Fresh Connect Central" with the provided address is correctly listed in the organization's facilities and appears accurately.

Agent Reporting Instructions (Critical for Debugging & Improvements!):
After performing the above:

Clearly confirm each step (#1 - #4) and post-implementation validation (✅ checks).

Explicitly report any errors, inconsistencies, or unexpected behaviors. Provide screenshots or log details to clearly document any issues.

Provide suggestions or improvements if the existing infrastructure or implementation flow showed gaps or limitations during this process.
