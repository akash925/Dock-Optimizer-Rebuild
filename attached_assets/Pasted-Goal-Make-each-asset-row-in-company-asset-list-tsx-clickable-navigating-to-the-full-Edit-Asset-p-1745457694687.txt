Goal:

Make each asset row in company-asset-list.tsx clickable—navigating to the full “Edit Asset” page for that asset (same route you already have on the Edit button).

Remove the extra button row (“Assets + Add / Import Files”) on the top of the Edit Asset page so it matches the Conmitto mock.

Style the Edit page to show a header “Edit Asset: <Asset Name>” below the main “Asset Manager” title, then render your existing multi-tab form (Basic Information, Details, Financial, Maintenance, Metadata) full-width.

Ensure the asset’s display image is shown above the form and can be changed via the existing “Change Display Image” workflow.

Keep all of the data-entry fields you’ve already built, but hide the “Assets + Add / Import Files” nav row so the page matches the attached screenshot.

Files to update:

client/src/components/asset-manager/company-asset-list.tsx

The route handler in your React Router config (if any) so <TableRow> wraps a <Link to={/assets/${asset.id}/edit}>

client/src/pages/asset-manager/EditAssetPage.tsx (or wherever your Edit page lives)

Steps:

In company-asset-list.tsx, import your router’s Link (or useNavigate) and wrap each <TableRow> in a <Link to={/assets/${row.id}/edit}>…</Link>. Remove any onClick on the Edit button—navigation now comes from the row click.

In your EditAssetPage component:

Delete or comment out the <div className="button-row">Assets + Add / Import Files</div> that sits above the “Edit Asset: …” heading.

Ensure the top of the page reads:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<h1>Asset Manager</h1>
<h2>Edit Asset: {asset.name}</h2>
Below that, render the existing form (<Tabs>…</Tabs>).

Verify that the <img src={asset.imageUrl} /> (or your Antd Avatar / UI component) is visible above the form and that the “Change Display Image” button still opens its upload modal.

Test by clicking on any row—should navigate to /assets/:id/edit and show the cleaned-up, full-screen edit page with your data intact.

Run npm run dev (or yarn dev) and confirm no new console or TypeScript errors.
