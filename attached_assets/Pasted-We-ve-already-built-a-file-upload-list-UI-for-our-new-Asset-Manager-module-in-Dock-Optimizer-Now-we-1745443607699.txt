We’ve already built a file-upload/list UI for our new Asset Manager module in Dock Optimizer. Now we need to turn it into a full CRUD “company asset registry”—not just blob storage. Please:

Database & API

Add a new assets table (or Drizzle model) with fields:

id (PK), name, manufacturer, owner, category, barcode, description, photo_url, created_at, updated_at

Generate Zod schemas (insert/update) for that model.

In the server (server/modules/assetManager), implement full REST handlers:

GET /api/asset-manager/assets (list all)

POST /api/asset-manager/assets (create a new asset)

PUT /api/asset-manager/assets/:id (update metadata)

DELETE /api/asset-manager/assets/:id

Wire them through your AssetManagerService → controllers → routes → storage (both MemStorage & DatabaseStorage).

React UI

Replace the “Upload File” tab content with a Create Asset form that posts to your new POST /assets endpoint. Form fields: Name, Manufacturer, Owner, Category (select), Description, Barcode, Photo (file).

Extend the All Files grid into an All Assets table: show all columns above plus photo thumbnail, with “Edit” (◻️ opens metadata in a modal), “Delete” (🗑️), “Download/View” buttons.

Hook up Edit modal to PUT and Delete button to DELETE. On success, refresh the list.

Keep file‐upload only for the photo—rest of the metadata lives in the DB.

Navigation & Layout

Remove the double-nested sidebar instance on the Asset Manager page (you currently see two sidebars layered). Fix your layout/components so there's just one.

Move Asset Manager out of the “Management” section and into the Dashboard section, immediately below Appointments in the left nav.

Update all route links (<NavLink> etc.) so users land at /asset-manager with that new menu order.

Please give me complete code snippets for:

Drizzle schema/model & migrations

Zod types

server modules: service, controllers, routes

updates to storage.ts

React components (form, table, modal, photo upload)

sidebar/nav changes

any small CSS/layout tweaks needed to eliminate the nested sidebar
