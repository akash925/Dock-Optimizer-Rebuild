🚩 Current Issues:
Appointment master editing doesn't default to step 1 when clicking Edit.

Custom questions added via the UI aren't persisting/saving properly.

Fields marked as "Included" and/or "Is Required" aren't correctly reflected on frontend/backend.

The UI isn’t properly reflecting saved questions upon returning.

🔍 Detailed Problem Diagnosis:
Editing Workflow:

Clicking "Edit" should always reset to step 1.

Currently, it's jumping straight to step 3, causing confusion.

Question Persistence:

Questions appear to save initially but aren’t present upon reopening.

Suggests frontend state is updating prematurely or backend storage logic isn't implemented correctly.

Frontend & Backend Synchronization:

"Included" and "Required" status must be synchronized clearly with backend API and database.

Frontend fields should directly reflect backend data upon form load.

🛠️ Actionable Technical Fixes:
✅ 1. Ensuring Edit Starts at Step 1:
Frontend fix (React State):

typescript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if (editingAppointmentTypeId) {
    setCurrentStep(1); // Always reset to Step 1 on edit initiation
  }
}, [editingAppointmentTypeId]);
✅ 2. Fixing Custom Question Persistence:
Frontend adjustments (React Hook example):

typescript
Copy
Edit
const handleSaveQuestions = async (questions) => {
  const response = await api.saveAppointmentQuestions(appointmentTypeId, questions);
  if (response.ok) {
    setQuestions(response.data);
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to save questions", response.error);
  }
};
Backend adjustments (API Endpoint pseudocode):

typescript
Copy
Edit
app.post('/api/saveAppointmentQuestions', async (req, res) => {
  const { appointmentTypeId, questions } = req.body;
  try {
    await db.transaction(async trx => {
      await trx('appointment_questions').where({ appointmentTypeId }).del();
      await trx('appointment_questions').insert(
        questions.map(q => ({ ...q, appointmentTypeId }))
      );
    });
    res.json({ success: true, data: questions });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
});
✅ 3. Synchronizing "Included" and "Is Required" Flags:
Ensure backend clearly stores these flags per question:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE appointment_questions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  appointmentTypeId INT REFERENCES appointment_types(id),
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  answerType TEXT,
  included BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);
Frontend (reflect changes immediately upon load):

typescript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadQuestions() {
    const response = await api.getAppointmentQuestions(appointmentTypeId);
    setQuestions(response.data);
  }
  loadQuestions();
}, [appointmentTypeId]);
✅ Comprehensive QA Checklist (after fixes):
 Clicking "Edit" always starts from Step 1.

 Custom questions added are persisted and correctly retrieved from backend.

 "Included" and "Required" statuses are reflected accurately on page reload.

 Frontend properly handles asynchronous calls to save and fetch custom questions.

📌 Recommended Next Steps:
Implement fixes sequentially:

First, the edit step reset logic.

Second, ensure backend reliably saves and fetches custom questions.

Third, verify frontend synchronizes flags ("Included"/"Required") correctly.

Deploy each fix incrementally and test thoroughly.

Document changes clearly in the codebase and share them with your team for easier maintenance.
