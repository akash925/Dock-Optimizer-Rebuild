This is excellent news that all 16 unit tests for `calculateAvailabilitySlots` are passing! This gives us great confidence in the backend availability logic.

Now, let's integrate this improved availability into the frontend.

**Objective:** Update the client-side code to use the new `/api/availability/v2` endpoint and its detailed slot information.

**Assumed Frontend File Structure (Please adapt if actual files differ):**
* A React Query hook for fetching availability: `client/src/hooks/useAvailability.ts`
* A component responsible for displaying time slots: `client/src/components/TimeSlotPicker.tsx` (or similar, like within a `BookingForm.tsx`).
* WebSocket handling logic that might need to invalidate React Query caches.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Update Availability Hook (`client/src/hooks/useAvailability.ts` - ASSUMED):**
    a.  Modify the function that fetches availability data.
    b.  Change the API endpoint URL it calls from any old availability endpoint(s) to the new `/api/availability/v2`.
    c.  Ensure it passes the required query parameters: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `facilityId`, `appointmentTypeId` (or `typeId`), and `bookingPageSlug` (if applicable for public booking contexts).
    d.  Update the React Query query key to reflect the new endpoint and its parameters to ensure proper caching and invalidation.
    e.  The hook should now expect and return the enhanced response structure from `/v2`, specifically the `slots: AvailabilitySlot[]` array, where `AvailabilitySlot` includes `time`, `available`, `remainingCapacity`, and `reason`.

2.  **Update Time Slot Display Component (`client/src/components/TimeSlotPicker.tsx` - ASSUMED):**
    a.  Modify this component (or the component where time slots are rendered) to consume the `slots: AvailabilitySlot[]` data from the updated React Query hook.
    b.  When rendering each time slot:
        i.  Use `slot.available` to determine if the slot should be displayed as available/selectable or disabled/greyed out.
        ii. Optionally, if `appointmentType.showRemainingSlots` is true (this setting might need to be fetched and passed to this component), display `slot.remainingCapacity`.
        iii. Optionally, display `slot.reason` as a tooltip or alongside the slot if it's unavailable.
    c.  Remove any client-side filtering of slots that might have been done previously based on just a simple list of times; rely on the `available` flag from the backend.

3.  **WebSocket Cache Invalidation (ASSUMED LOGIC):**
    a.  Review the existing WebSocket message handling for `schedule_update` messages.
    b.  Ensure that upon receiving a relevant `schedule_update`, the React Query cache for the `/api/availability/v2` queries (matching the keys used in the updated hook) is invalidated to trigger a refetch and update the UI with the latest availability.

**Output:**
Please provide the modified code for:
- `client/src/hooks/useAvailability.ts` (or its actual equivalent)
- `client/src/components/TimeSlotPicker.tsx` (or its actual equivalent where slots are displayed)
- Any relevant WebSocket handling snippets if they need adjustment for cache invalidation.

Clearly indicate any assumptions made about file names or existing component structure.
