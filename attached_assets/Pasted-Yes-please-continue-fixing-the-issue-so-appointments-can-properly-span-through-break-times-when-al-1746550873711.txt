Yes, please continue fixing the issue so appointments can properly span through break times when `allowAppointmentsThroughBreaks` is true.

It appears the `allowAppointmentsThroughBreaks` field (and potentially other fields from the `appointmentType` object) might not be consistently accessed due to snake_case vs. camelCase naming, similar to the issue previously fixed for facility fields.

**Task:**

In the `calculateAvailabilitySlots` function within `server/src/services/availability.ts`:

1.  **Normalize `appointmentType` Fields:**
    * Immediately after fetching the `appointmentType` object using `storage.getAppointmentType(...)`, ensure that all relevant fields from it are accessible via camelCase, even if they are stored in snake_case in the database.
    * You can achieve this by:
        * Creating and using a helper function like `getAppointmentTypeField(appointmentTypeObject, camelCaseName, snakeCaseName, defaultValue)` similar to what was done for facility fields.
        * Or, by creating a new normalized `appointmentType` object with camelCase keys mapped from potential snake_case keys.
    * Ensure at least the following `appointmentType` fields are correctly accessed using this normalized approach:
        * `overrideFacilityHours`
        * `allowAppointmentsThroughBreaks`
        * `duration`
        * `bufferTime`
        * `maxConcurrent`
        * `timezone` (if it exists on appointmentType and is used as a fallback)

2.  **Refine Break Time Logic Check:**
    * Ensure the condition for checking breaks uses the **correctly accessed/normalized** `allowAppointmentsThroughBreaks` value. The logic should effectively be:
        ```typescript
        // Inside the slot generation loop, after a slot is initially deemed available based on capacity
        const normalizedAllowAppointmentsThroughBreaks = /* Get normalized value for appointmentType.allowAppointmentsThroughBreaks */;

        if (breakStartTimeStr && breakEndTimeStr && !normalizedAllowAppointmentsThroughBreaks) {
            // ... existing logic to convert breakStartTimeStr/breakEndTimeStr to Date objects ...
            // ... existing logic to check for overlap ...
            if (/* overlaps with break */) {
                // Mark slot as unavailable due to break time
                slot.available = false;
                slot.remainingCapacity = 0;
                slot.remaining = 0;
                slot.reason = "Break Time";
            }
        }
        ```

3.  **DB Type Correction:** In both `WorkspaceRelevantAppointmentsForDay` and `calculateAvailabilitySlots`, please ensure the `db` parameter is properly typed. It's currently `db: any`. Replace `any` with the correct DrizzleDBInstance type that is imported from your `../../db` file.

**Output:**
Please provide the **complete, updated `calculateAvailabilitySlots` function** and, if modified, the `WorkspaceRelevantAppointmentsForDay` function from `availability.ts`, incorporating these fixes.
