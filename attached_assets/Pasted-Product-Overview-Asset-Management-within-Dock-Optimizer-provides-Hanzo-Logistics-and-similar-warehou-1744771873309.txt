Product Overview
Asset Management within Dock Optimizer provides Hanzo Logistics and similar warehouse operators an integrated, lightweight, yet powerful way to manage critical warehouse assets (forklifts, pallet jacks, trailers, containers, etc.) directly alongside their dock scheduling operations. The integrated asset tab will eliminate the need for separate systems, allowing unified visibility of assets' availability, maintenance schedules, utilization rates, and key operational insightsâ€”all directly within Dock Optimizer.

Capture basic details: Asset Name, Type, Asset ID, Purchase Date, Location, Vendor.

Upload supporting documents (manuals, warranties, inspection records).

Categorization & Tagging:

Custom tags (e.g., forklifts, pallet jacks, containers).

Location-specific categorization for multi-site warehouses.

Asset Status Tracking:

Real-time asset availability: (Available, In-use, Under Maintenance, Reserved).

Easy search and filter functionality.

2. Maintenance Scheduling & Tracking
Preventive Maintenance Management:

Set customizable recurring maintenance schedules.

Track and manage maintenance events, due dates, overdue assets.

Repair & Incident Logging:

Record and document asset downtime.

Assign repair tasks, track completion, and log associated costs.

Notification & Alerts:

Automated notifications for upcoming or overdue maintenance tasks.

Email or internal system alerts for asset breakdowns or maintenance needs.

3. Utilization & Reporting
Asset Utilization Tracking:

Usage logs linked to scheduled dock operations.

Track idle time vs active utilization of key assets.

Insights & Reports:

Quick summaries: asset uptime, downtime, usage patterns.

Exportable reports (CSV/Excel) for audits, cost analysis, and performance reviews.

4. Integration with Dock Scheduling
Link asset usage to specific dock appointments to reflect real-time availability.

Visual indicators within the dock schedule if an asset (forklift, trailer) is reserved or unavailable.

User Interface Enhancements
Dedicated "Assets" tab clearly placed in the main navigation bar.

Clean, intuitive dashboard showing at-a-glance insights:

Total assets, assets under maintenance, and usage rate.

Seamless integration into existing Dock Optimizer interface design for familiarity and ease of use.

Technical Specifications & Stack
Built within the existing Replit-based Dock Optimizer rebuild.

Lightweight database structure for rapid lookups and updates (ideally SQLite or PostgreSQL for ease and scalability).

React or similar front-end framework for a responsive, easy-to-navigate UI.

Robust backend logic (Python with FastAPI or Flask) to manage CRUD operations, scheduling logic, and notifications efficiently.

Value Proposition
Unified Platform: Eliminates the complexity and cost of maintaining separate asset management software.

Operational Clarity: Enhanced visibility and control over warehouse assets directly tied to operational scheduling.

Cost Savings: Reduced downtime through proactive maintenance, clearer tracking of asset lifecycle and operational efficiency.
