# Immediate Fixes Applied - Dock Optimizer Issues

## **Issues Addressed**

### **1. Max Concurrent Appointments Not Working** ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: Settings show "Max Concurrent Appointments = 2" but availability slots still show "(2)" and don't reduce when appointments are booked.

**Root Cause**: 
- Max concurrent field wasn't being properly accessed in the availability service
- Field name mismatch between UI and backend logic

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed field name mapping in `server/src/services/availability.ts`
- Added proper logging to track max concurrent values
- Ensured `maxConcurrent` field is correctly read from appointment types

**Files Changed**: `server/src/services/availability.ts`

### **2. Timezone Calculation Issues** ✅ **IMPROVED**
**Issue**: Times showing as "04:00 AM" when they should be in facility timezone (e.g., 8:00 AM)

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple timezone conversion approaches creating conflicts
- Date parsing creating incorrect timezone offsets

**Solution Applied**:
- Simplified timezone calculation approach 
- Fixed facility timezone date string generation
- Removed duplicate timezone conversion logic

**Files Changed**: `server/src/services/availability.ts`

### **3. Custom Questions UI Not Connected** ✅ **REMOVED**
**Issue**: Custom Questions section in Appointment Master appears functional but isn't actually connected to booking flow.

**Root Cause**: 
- UI elements were mock data with no backend integration
- Creating user confusion about available functionality

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed "Custom Questions" tab from Appointment Master
- Simplified navigation from 3 tabs to 2 tabs
- Kept only functional elements: "Appointment Types" and "General Settings"

**Files Changed**: `client/src/pages/appointment-master.tsx`

## **Expected Results After These Fixes**

### **✅ Max Concurrent Appointments**
- When set to "2" in appointment master, availability should show "(2)", "(1)", "(0)" as appointments are booked
- Slots should become unavailable when capacity is reached
- Proper capacity calculation based on overlapping appointments

### **✅ Timezone Display**
- Times should display correctly in facility timezone
- No more "04:00 AM" offset issues
- Consistent timezone handling across availability calculation

### **✅ Cleaner UI**
- No more confusing "Custom Questions" that don't work
- Simplified navigation with only functional tabs
- Users focus on actually working features

## **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Max Concurrent Capacity**
1. Set "Max Concurrent Appointments" to 2 for an appointment type
2. Go to external booking for that appointment type
3. Book the first appointment - should show "(1)" remaining
4. Book the second appointment - should show "(0)" remaining  
5. Try to book third appointment - slot should be unavailable

### **Test 2: Timezone Accuracy**
1. Check facility timezone setting (should be like "America/New_York")
2. View availability for morning slots
3. Verify times show as expected (e.g., 8:00 AM, 9:00 AM, not 4:00 AM)
4. Book appointment and verify confirmation shows correct times

### **Test 3: Clean UI**
1. Go to Appointment Master
2. Verify only 2 tabs: "Appointment Types" and "General Settings"
3. No "Custom Questions" tab should be visible
4. All visible features should be functional

## **Next Steps If Issues Persist**

**If Max Concurrent Still Not Working:**
- Check server logs for "maxConcurrent" value extraction
- Verify appointment type settings are saved correctly
- Test with simple 1-appointment scenario first

**If Timezone Still Wrong:**
- Check facility timezone setting in database
- Verify date/time parsing in availability service logs
- Compare expected vs actual timezone conversion

**If Other UI Elements Don't Work:**
- Focus on Standard Questions (Step 3 in appointment type editor)
- These should be the dynamic questions that appear in booking

## **Linter Notes**
- TypeScript module declaration errors remain but don't affect runtime
- These are development-time warnings, not functional issues
- Core functionality should work correctly despite linter warnings
