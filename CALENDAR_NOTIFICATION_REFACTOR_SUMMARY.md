CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_schedules_tenant_time ON schedules (tenant_id, start_time, end_time);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_schedules_tenant_status ON schedules (tenant_id, status);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_schedules_facility_time ON schedules (facility_id, start_time);

-- Notification optimization indexes  
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_notifications_user_read ON notifications (user_id, is_read, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_notifications_tenant_type ON notifications (user_id, type, created_at DESC);
```
