# Timezone & Booking Page Issues - FIXES APPLIED

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded Booking Page Links** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Checkout emails were using hardcoded `/external/fresh-connect-booking` URLs instead of dynamic booking page URLs.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `getBookingPageUrl(schedule, host)` helper function in `server/notifications.ts`
- Replaced all hardcoded booking page URLs with dynamic ones based on tenant/facility context
- Updated checkout, confirmation, reschedule, and cancellation emails to use proper booking page URLs

**Files Modified**:
- `server/notifications.ts` - Added helper function and updated all email functions

### 2. **Organization Database Tables** ✅ CONFIRMED EXISTS
**Problem**: Console logs showed errors about missing `organization_default_hours` and `organization_holidays` tables.

**Status**: 
- ✅ Tables already exist in database
- ✅ Migration files are present
- ✅ API endpoints are configured

**Location**: The organization settings are accessible at `/organization-settings` page

### 3. **BOL and Notes in Checkout** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: BOL data and checkout notes weren't being properly included in checkout emails.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified checkout route in `server/routes.ts` to include checkout notes in enhanced schedule
- Checkout emails now properly include BOL data and notes from the appointment

### 4. **Timezone Display Issues** ✅ INVESTIGATED
**Problem**: Reported timezone showing as UTC instead of proper timezone.

**Status**: 
- The timezone formatting code appears correct (America/New_York with EDT abbreviation)
- Email logs show proper timezone formatting
- May be a display issue rather than a data issue

## How to Access Organization Settings

### For Users:
1. Navigate to `/organization-settings` (if you have admin/manager access)
2. Use the "Default Hours" tab to configure organization-wide operating hours
3. Use the "Holidays" tab to set organization holidays
4. These settings affect appointment availability calculations

### For Developers:
- Organization settings API: `/api/organizations/default-hours`
- Holiday settings API: `/api/organizations/holidays`
- Settings page component: `client/src/pages/organization-settings.tsx`

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Checkout Process:
1. Create a test appointment with BOL upload and notes
2. Check the appointment in (status: in-progress)
3. Check the appointment out with notes
4. Verify the checkout email includes:
   - ✅ Dynamic booking page URL (not hardcoded fresh-connect-booking)
   - ✅ BOL information if uploaded
   - ✅ Checkout notes
   - ✅ Proper timezone formatting

### Test Organization Settings:
1. Navigate to `/organization-settings`
2. Go to "Default Hours" tab
3. Configure operating hours for each day
4. Set break times
5. Save and verify availability calculations use these hours

### Test Booking Page URLs:
1. Check confirmation emails for proper booking page URLs
2. URLs should be `/external/{dynamic-slug}` not hardcoded to fresh-connect-booking
3. QR codes should point to correct booking page

## Remaining Items to Investigate

### Appointment HAN-745736 (Schedule ID 192):
- **Status**: You mentioned you tested checkout on this appointment
- **Expected**: BOL and notes should now be visible in the checkout email
- **Action**: Re-test checkout process to confirm BOL data appears

### Timezone Display:
- **Logs show**: Proper timezone formatting (EDT, America/New_York)
- **Reported**: Times showing in UTC
- **Action**: Check email client rendering vs. console logs
- **Note**: The timezone calculation code looks correct

### Calendar Blocked Days:
- **Status**: Organization holidays table exists
- **Action**: Verify holidays are being loaded in calendar component
- **Location**: Check `/api/organizations/holidays` endpoint

## Files Modified Summary

1. **server/notifications.ts**
   - Added `getBookingPageUrl()` helper function
   - Updated all email functions to use dynamic booking page URLs

2. **server/routes.ts** 
   - Fixed checkout route to include notes in enhanced schedule

3. **scripts/create-missing-organization-tables.cjs**
   - Created script to verify organization tables exist (they do)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the checkout process** with a real appointment to confirm BOL/notes display
2. **Verify timezone display** in actual email clients vs. console logs  
3. **Check calendar integration** with organization holidays
4. **Add navigation link** to organization settings if users can't find it

All major hardcoded booking page issues have been resolved. The organization settings infrastructure exists and should be working properly.
