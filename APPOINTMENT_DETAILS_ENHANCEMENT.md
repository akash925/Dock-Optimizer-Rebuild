# ðŸš€ APPOINTMENT DETAILS ENHANCEMENT

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Loading in Appointments List**
**Problem**: Appointment details modal showed infinite loading spinner when accessed from the appointments list.

**Root Cause**: `EnhancedAppointmentDetails` component had conflicts and data mismatch issues.

**Solution**: Replaced with the proven working `AppointmentDetails` component from the calendar view.

### 2. **Inconsistent Modal Experience**
**Problem**: Different appointment details modals in calendar vs appointments list created inconsistent UX.

**Solution**: Unified to use the same robust `AppointmentDetails` component across the entire application.
