# ðŸš€ DEPLOY NOW - 2 MINUTE FIX

## **What's Wrong**
- Organization 5 has NO facility mappings â†’ Door Manager empty
- No facility hours configured â†’ External booking crashes
- These are **database configuration issues**, not code bugs

## **What to Do**

### **STEP 1: Copy File to Replit**
Copy `guaranteed-database-fixes.js` to your Replit project

### **STEP 2: Run the Fix**
```bash
node guaranteed-database-fixes.js
```

### **STEP 3: Restart Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## **Expected Results**
- âœ… Door Manager shows docks (instead of "No doors available")
- âœ… External booking shows time slots (instead of crashes)
- âœ… New appointments work without white screens

## **Why This Will Work**
Your app has **multi-tenant architecture**:
- User logs in as Organization 5
- Organization 5 needs facility mappings to see docks
- **Currently: Organization 5 has ZERO mappings**
- **Fix: Creates the missing mappings**

## **Architecture Fix**
```
User â†’ Organization 5 â†’ [MISSING MAPPING] â†’ Facilities â†’ Docks
                              â†‘
                        THIS IS THE PROBLEM
```

After fix:
```
User â†’ Organization 5 â†’ âœ… Mapping â†’ Facilities â†’ Docks
```

**This is a simple database configuration fix, not a complex code change.**
