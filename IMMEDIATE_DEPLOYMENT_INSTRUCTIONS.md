## ðŸš¨ **IF SCRIPT FAILS**

If the automated script has issues, run these manual commands:

### **Manual Database Fix (Replit Shell)**
```sql
# Connect to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Fix organization mapping
INSERT INTO organization_facilities (organization_id, facility_id, created_at) 
VALUES (5, 7, NOW()) 
ON CONFLICT (organization_id, facility_id) DO NOTHING;

# Verify fix
SELECT d.id, d.name, f.name as facility_name
FROM docks d
JOIN facilities f ON d.facility_id = f.id
JOIN organization_facilities of ON f.id = of.facility_id
WHERE of.organization_id = 5;

\q
```

### **Manual File Fixes**
If any file edits fail, check that:
- `server/src/services/availability.ts` exists
- `client/src/pages/door-manager.tsx` exists
- File permissions allow editing
